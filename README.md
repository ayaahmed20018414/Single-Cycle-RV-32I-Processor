# Single-Cycle-RV-32I-Processor
In this project, I implemented a 32-bit single-cycle microarchitecture RISC-V processor based on Harvard Architecture. The single cycle microarchitecture executes an entire instruction in one cycle. In other words, instruction fetch, instruction decode, execute, write back, and program counter update occurs within a single clock cycle.
